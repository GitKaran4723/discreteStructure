## Applications of Set operations in CS

1. **Databases**: Combine and filter query results using operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.
2. **Search Engines**: Process search queries and manage text processing tasks like keyword extraction.
3. **Data Structures**: Optimize operations in hash sets, bit arrays, and graph algorithms.
4. **Networking**: Manage routing tables and apply firewall rules.
5. **Machine Learning**: Select features and evaluate clustering or classification results.
6. **Compilers**: Define and process languages, and handle syntax parsing.
7. **Security**: Manage access control and perform cryptographic operations.
8. **Distributed Computing**: Partition data and maintain consistency across nodes.
9. **Formal Verification**: Explore state spaces in system verification.
