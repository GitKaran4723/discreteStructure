## Basic Set Symbols
1. **{ }**: **Set Brackets**
   - Used to define a set. For example, `{1, 2, 3}` is a set containing the elements 1, 2, and 3.

2. **∈**: **Element of**
   - Indicates that an object is an element of a set. For example, `2 ∈ {1, 2, 3}` means 2 is an element of the set `{1, 2, 3}`.

3. **∉**: **Not an element of**
   - Indicates that an object is not an element of a set. For example, `4 ∉ {1, 2, 3}` means 4 is not an element of the set `{1, 2, 3}`.

4. **|**: **Such that**
   - Used in set builder notation. For example, `{x | x > 0}` means "the set of all x such that x is greater than 0."

5. **∅**: **Empty set**
   - Represents a set with no elements. For example, `∅` or `{}`.

6. **N, Z, Q, R, C**: **Standard sets of numbers**
   - **N**: Natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - **Z**: Integers (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)
   - **Q**: Rational numbers (fractions of integers)
   - **R**: Real numbers (all numbers on the number line)
   - **C**: Complex numbers (numbers that have a real part and an imaginary part)

### Operations on Sets
1. **∪**: **Union**
   - The union of two sets is a set containing all elements from both sets. For example, `{1, 2} ∪ {2, 3}` gives `{1, 2, 3}`.

2. **∩**: **Intersection**
   - The intersection of two sets is a set containing only the elements common to both sets. For example, `{1, 2} ∩ {2, 3}` gives `{2}`.

3. **−**: **Difference**
   - The difference of two sets is a set containing elements of the first set that are not in the second set. For example, `{1, 2} − {2, 3}` gives `{1}`.

4. **Δ**: **Symmetric Difference**
   - The symmetric difference of two sets is a set containing elements in either of the sets but not in their intersection. For example, `{1, 2} Δ {2, 3}` gives `{1, 3}`.

5. **×**: **Cartesian Product**
   - The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs formed by taking an element from the first set and an element from the second set. For example, `{1, 2} × {3, 4}` gives `{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}`.

### Set Relations
1. **⊆**: **Subset**
   - A set \\( A \\) is a subset of \\( B \\) if all elements of \\( A \\) are also in \\( B \\). For example, `{1, 2} ⊆ {1, 2, 3}`.

2. **⊂**: **Proper Subset**
   - A set \\( A \\) is a proper subset of \\( B \\) if \\( A \\) is a subset of \\( B \\) and \\( A \\) is not equal to \\( B \\). For example, `{1, 2} ⊂ {1, 2, 3}`.

3. **⊇**: **Superset**
   - A set \\( A \\) is a superset of \\( B \\) if \\( B \\) is a subset of \\( A \\). For example, `{1, 2, 3} ⊇ {1, 2}`.

4. **⊃**: **Proper Superset**
   - A set \\( A \\) is a proper superset of \\( B \\) if \\( A \\) is a superset of \\( B \\) and \\( A \\) is not equal to \\( B \\). For example, `{1, 2, 3} ⊃ {1, 2}`.

### Additional Symbols
1. **|A|**: **Cardinality**
   - Represents the number of elements in a set \\( A \\). For example, if \\( A = {1, 2, 3} \\), then \\( |A| = 3 \\).

2. **℘(A)**: **Power Set**
   - The power set of \\( A \\) is the set of all subsets of \\( A \\). For example, if \\( A = {1, 2} \\), then \\( ℘(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}} \\).

3. **∀**: **For all**
   - Used to denote that something is true for all elements of a set. For example, \\( ∀x ∈ A \\), P(x) indicates that the property P(x) holds for all elements x in the set A.

4. **∃**: **There exists**
   - Indicates the existence of at least one element in a set for which a property holds. For example, \\( ∃x ∈ A \\), P(x) indicates that there is at least one element x in set A for which the property P(x) is true.

5. **∖**: **Set Minus**
   - Represents the relative complement of one set in another, i.e., the set of elements in one set but not in the other. For example, if \\( A = {1, 2, 3} \\) and \\( B = {2, 3} \\), then \\( A ∖ B = {1} \\).

- A visual representation of the relationships between sets, usually represented by overlapping circles.

These symbols form the foundation of set theory, and they are used extensively in mathematics to describe and analyze collections of objects.
