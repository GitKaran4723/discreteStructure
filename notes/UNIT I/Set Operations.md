## Binary Operations in Set Theory

**Introduction**
Binary operations are **fundamental concepts** in set theory that involve **two sets** and produce **another set**. These operations are essential in understanding **relationships between different sets**. The three most common binary operations in set theory are **union, intersection, and symmetric difference**. Each operation has a specific role in determining the elements that result from the combination of two sets.

## 1. Union (A ∪ B)

**Definition**  
The union of two sets $A$ and $B$ is a set that contains all elements that are either in $A$, in $B$, or in both. It represents the combination of the elements from both sets without duplication.

**Mathematical Expression**  
$$A \cup B = \\{ x \mid x \in A \text\{ or \} x \in B \\}$$

**Example**  
Let $A = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $B = \\{2, 3\\}$. Then the union of $A$ and $B$ is:
$$A \cup B = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$$

### 2. Intersection (A ∩ B)

**Definition**  
The intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$ is a set that contains **all elements** that are common to both $A$ and $B$. It represents the overlap between the two sets.

**Mathematical Expression**  
$$A \cap B = \\{ x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \\}$$

**Example**  
Let $A = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $B = \\{2, 3\\}$. Then the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is:
$$A \cap B = \\{2\\}$$

### 3. Symmetric Difference (A Δ B)

**Definition**  
The symmetric difference between two sets $A$ and $B$ is a set that contains all elements that are in either $A$ or $B$ but not in both. It essentially represents the elements that are unique to each set when compared to each other.

**Mathematical Expression**  
$$A \Delta B = \\{ x \mid (x \in A \text{ or } x \in B) \text{ and } x \notin (A \cap B) \\}$$

**Example**  
Let $A = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $B = \\{2, 3\\}$. Then the symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$ is:
$$A \Delta B = \\{1, 3\\}$$

## Example with Three Sets

Given:
- Universal set $U = \\{1, 2, 3, \dots, 10\\}$
- $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$
- $B = \\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$
- $C = \\{7, 8, 9\\}$

**Calculations:**
- $A \cap B = \\{3, 4, 5\\}$ (common elements in both $A$ and $B$)
- $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ (all elements in either $A$ or $B$ or both)
- $A \Delta B = \{1, 2, 6, 7\}$ (elements in $A$ or $B$ but not in both)
- $A \cup C = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9\}$ (all elements in either $A$ or $C$ or both)
- $A \Delta C = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9\}$ (elements in $A$ or $C$ but not in both)

### Complement of a Set

**Definition**  
The complement of a set $A$ refers to the set of all elements in the universal set $U $ that are not in $A$. It essentially represents everything outside of $A$ within the context of the universal set.

**Mathematical Expression**  
If $U$ is the universal set and $A \subseteq U$, then the complement of $A$, denoted by $A'$, is:
$$A' = \{ x \in U \mid x \notin A \}$$

**Example**  
Let the universal set $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$ and $A = \{2, 4, 6\}$ be a subset of $U$. The complement of $A$, denoted by $A'$, is:
$$A' = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 8\}$$

**Visual Representation**
In a Venn diagram, the complement of $A$ is represented by the area of the universal set $U$ outside the circle representing $A$.

### Summary

- **Union ($A \cup B$)**: Combines all elements from two sets.
- **Intersection ($A \cap B$)**: Captures elements common to both sets.
- **Symmetric Difference ($A \Delta B$)**: Identifies elements that are unique to each set.
- **Complement ($A'$)**: Represents all elements outside a set within the universal set.

These operations are the building blocks of set theory, providing a foundation for more complex mathematical concepts and applications.
