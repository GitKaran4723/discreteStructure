# Counting and Venn Diagrams

For sets $A, B# from a finite universe $U$ the following venn diagrams will help us in obtaining counting formula for $| \overline{A} |$ and $| A \cap B |$ in temrs of $|U|, |A|, |B|, |A \cap B|$

for example,
$| A | + | \overline{A} |$ = $| U |$
As shown in the following venn diagram
