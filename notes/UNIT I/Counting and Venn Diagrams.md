# Counting and Venn Diagrams

## Venn Diagrams

### $A$ and $\overline{A}$


## Counting

For sets $A, B$ from a finite universe $U$ the following venn diagrams will help us in obtaining counting formula for $| \overline{A} |$ and $| A \cap B |$ in temrs of $|U|, |A|, |B|, |A \cap B|$

for example,
$| A | + | \overline{A} |$ = $| U |$

As shown in the following venn diagram

![Counting Complement](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-1tMg802c8qXefm_a440zkcGeBjoC9vI)

$\implies | \overline{A} | = | U | + | A |$

to find the number of elements in $ \overline{A} $ we need to subtract $A$ from $U$.

Consider the following venn diagram for set $A, B$ and $U$

![Disjoint sets](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/)

In this venn diagram $A$ and $B$ are disjoint thus do not have nay common elements

for example,
$U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ , $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $B = \\{4, 5, 6\\}$
in this example we have $A \cap B$ = $\emptyset$ or $\\{\\}$

thus we have $|A \cap B| = |A| + |B|$
